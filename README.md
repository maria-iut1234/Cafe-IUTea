<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/Xer0Bytes/Innuo/assets/95132675/0dc4247f-0347-4f72-8c05-79d241e4cb0d) -->

(This project was created for the academic course CSE4410 - Database Management Systems II Lab).

This web application caters specifically to cafes and similar establishments, offering a comprehensive platform for managers and staff to efficiently handle and monitor orders and inventory. 

Key functionalities include robust user authentication, CRUD operations for managing employees, ingredients, and recipes. Detailed order management capabilities include automated cost calculations and real-time inventory updates. The system also features advanced search functionalities for navigating extensive ingredient lists, as well as automated alerts and removal of items nearing or past expiry dates. Additionally, users benefit from a user-friendly media upload feature for easy access to recipe contents.

The manager side ensures that managers will be able to hire employees, fire employees, approve any employee requests and edit any menu details of their respective branch shop while the employee side ensures that employees will be able to list the ordered items, check inventory status and contact their manager for any difficulties or requests.
